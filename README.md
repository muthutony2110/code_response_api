# LLM-Based Code Classification & Response APIs

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains multiple **LLM-powered chatbot and Code Response API implementations** focused on building a **coding-only AI assistant**.  
The projects demonstrate how Large Language Models can be **controlled, integrated, and deployed** through REST APIs while storing user interaction history using different backend storage approaches.

Each implementation explores a variation of the same core idea using **JSON files, SQL Server, Redis DB, and UI-based interaction**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea
- Respond **only to programming and coding-related queries**
- Reject or restrict non-technical questions
- Use prompt tuning to control LLM behavior
- Expose functionality through **Flask-based REST APIs**
- Store and retrieve user query–response history
- Validate API behavior using **Postman**

---

## 📂 Implementations Included
- **JSON-based LLM Chatbot** – lightweight version using file-based storage  
- **SQL Server–Backed Code Response API** – persistent, structured history storage  
- **Redis DB–Integrated API** – high-performance in-memory chat history handling  
- **UI-Integrated Code Response API** – simple front-end connected to backend APIs  

Each folder in this repository represents one of the above implementations.
