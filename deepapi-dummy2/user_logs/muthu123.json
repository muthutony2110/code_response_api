    "response": "Here's a simple and efficient way to write a Python function that checks if a number is prime:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if the number n is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    # 0, 1, and negative numbers are not prime\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    # 2 and 3 are prime numbers\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    # Eliminate multiples of 2 and 3\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 5 to the square root of n\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_prime(11))  # Output: True\nprint(is_prime(4))   # Output: False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Step 1:** The function `is_prime` takes an integer `n` as input.\n- **Step 2:** It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `False` because these numbers are not prime.\n- **Step 3:** If the number is 2 or 3, it returns `True` since both are prime numbers.\n- **Step 4:** It then eliminates even numbers and multiples of 3 by checking if `n % 2 == 0` or `n % 3 == 0`. If true, it returns `False`.\n- **Step 5:** For numbers greater than 3, it uses a loop to check for factors starting from 5, incrementing by 6 each time (to skip even and multiples of 3). The loop continues until `i * i` exceeds `n`. If any factor is found, it returns `False`.\n- **Step 6:** If no factors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime."

    "response": "Sure! Prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. In other words, they cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers. Here are a few examples of prime numbers along with their explanations:\n\n### Examples of Prime Numbers:\n1. **2**: The smallest prime number is 2. It can only be divided evenly by 1 and 2. No other whole numbers multiply to give 2.\n   - Example: `is_prime(2)` returns `True` because 2 is a prime number.\n\n2. **3**: Another very small prime number, which can only be divided evenly by 1 and 3. No other whole numbers multiply to give 3.\n   - Example: `is_prime(3)` returns `True` because 3 is a prime number.\n\n3. **5**: The next prime number, which cannot be divided evenly by any other whole numbers except for 1 and itself.\n   - Example: `is_prime(5)` returns `True` because 5 is a prime number.\n\n4. **7**: Another small prime number that has no divisors other than 1 and 7.\n   - Example: `is_prime(7)` returns `True` because 7 is a prime number.\n\n5. **11**: A larger prime number, which cannot be divided evenly by any whole numbers except for 1 and itself.\n   - Example: `is_prime(11)` returns `True` because 11 is a prime number.\n\n6. **4**: The first composite number (not prime) that has divisors other than 1 and itself, specifically 2 and 4.\n   - Example: `is_prime(4)` returns `False` because 4 is not a prime number.\n\n7. **9**: Another composite number (not prime), which can be divided evenly by 3 and 9 itself.\n   - Example: `is_prime(9)` returns `False` because 9 is not a prime number.\n\n### How to Use the Prime Check Function in Python:\nYou can use the function provided earlier to check if a number is prime. Here's how you might call it from your script or in an interactive session:\n\n```python\nprint(is_prime(2))  # Output: True\nprint(is_prime(3))  # Output: True\nprint(is_prime(5))  # Output: True\nprint(is_prime(7))  # Output: True\nprint(is_prime(4))  # Output: False\nprint(is_prime(9))  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis function efficiently checks for prime numbers using a few simple conditional statements and loops, making it easy to determine if a number is prime or not."
