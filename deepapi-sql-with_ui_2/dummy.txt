. Python – Temperature Converter
Create a Python program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Modify the program to also convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using functions.

Add user input to let the user choose which conversion to perform.

Add input validation (ensure the user enters a number).

Add a loop to allow multiple conversions until the user decides to quit.

2. Java – Simple Interest Calculator
Write a Java program to calculate simple interest (P × R × T / 100).

Convert the code to use a method for calculating interest.

Add user input for principal, rate, and time.

Add a feature to calculate compound interest as well.

Add a menu for the user to choose between simple or compound interest calculation.

3. JavaScript – Basic To-Do List
Create a simple JavaScript program to add items to a to-do list (array).

Add functionality to remove items from the list.

Display the list dynamically on a web page.

Add the ability to mark tasks as completed.

Store tasks in localStorage so the list persists after refresh.

4. C++ – Student Grade Calculator
Write a C++ program to calculate the average of 3 subject marks.

Modify the program to calculate grades based on the average.

Convert the code to use functions for average and grade calculation.

Add a feature to handle multiple students using arrays.

Add file handling to save student results to a text file.

5. PHP – Contact Form
Create a PHP script to display a simple contact form (name, email, message).

Add server-side validation to ensure required fields are filled.

Save submitted messages to a text file.

Send an email notification when a form is submitted.

Add a page to display all submitted messages in a table format.




=================



nstall ngrok
Go to https://ngrok.com/download

Download & extract the binary (or use choco install ngrok on Windows if you have Chocolatey).

Add ngrok to your PATH so you can run ngrok from any terminal.

2. (Optional but recommended) Create an ngrok account
Sign up at ngrok.com.

Get your auth token (from dashboard).

Set it up:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
This avoids session timeouts and gives you a stable free URL.

3. Start your Flask app
Run your app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Ensure it’s running on port 8500 (as per your code).

4. Start ngrok
Open a new terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 8500
You’ll see output like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Forwarding    https://abcd-1234.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8500
Copy the https://abcd-1234.ngrok-free.app link.

5. Share the URL
Send that link to your lead or anyone — they can open it in their browser and access your Flask app.

6. Keep the terminal open
Don’t close the terminal running ngrok — if you close it, the link stops working.

Your app & ngrok must stay running for others to access.

7. (Optional) Run both at once
If you want to start Flask & ngrok together automatically:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py & ngrok http 8500
(Works in Git Bash or Linux; for Windows PowerShell we’ll need a small script — I can make one for you.)

Do you want me to make a one-click .bat file for Windows that runs Flask + ngrok together and prints the public URL?
That way, you won’t have to type commands each time. Should I create it?
